In a house prediction machine learning project, algorithms analyze historical real estate data to predict property prices. Utilizing features like location, size, amenities, and market trends, the model learns patterns and correlations. The project involves data preprocessing, where missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded. Feature scaling ensures uniformity in data units. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Algorithms such as linear regression or decision trees are chosen, their parameters tuned for optimal performance. The model's accuracy is assessed on test data, providing insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
